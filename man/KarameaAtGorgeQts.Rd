Karamea at Gorge, time series of hourly streamflows
}
\description{
Time series with hourly streamflows for the Karamea River(New Zealand) measured at the gauging station "Gorge", for the period 01/Jan/1980 to 31/Dec/1985.
Station Number: 95102, Easting Coordinate (NZMG): 2444629.0, Northing Coordinate (NZMG): 5994427.0, Catchment Area (km2): 1160.0.

In November 25th, 2023, the time zone of this data sete was changed from "none" (i.e., your local time zone was used every time you loaded this dataset)
to GMT+12, in order to avoid missing datetimes at times where daylight saving time ocurred. After this change, the initial DateTime of this dataset changed 
from "1980-01-01 08:15:00 -03" (in my local computer) to "1980-01-01 00:15:00" (everywhere). 
Only two NA elements were removed from the origanl dataset: the first one and the last one.
