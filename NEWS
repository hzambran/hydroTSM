        o 'drawTimeAxis      : -) new argument 'mgp' to provide greater flexibility.

        o 'dm2seasonal.data.frame'     : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing) 
        o 'hydrokrige.data.frame'      : default value for 'dates' argument was set to 1 (before it was missing)
