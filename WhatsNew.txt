0.3-0	01-Sep-2011

	o hydroTSM now depends on xts >= 0.8-2 (=> zoo >= 1.7-2), in order to make use of improved plotting capabilities for ts objects.
	  The first release of 'xts' after the 0.8-0 (which was set as the default building block for plotting time series in hydroTSM) 
	  was the 0.8-2, and appeared on CRAN on August 9th, 2011	
	o NAMESPACE created, which leads to reduced dependency of packages e1071, gstat, automap, sp
	o 'maptools' package is now "suggested" instead of a dependence. It is only used for reading shapefiles in the 
	  'hydrokrige' and 'mspplot' functions.	
	o 'drawxaxis'       : -) it was re-written, in order to take advantage of some features of the 'xts' 
			         package (now added as a dependence), and now it should work with sub-daily 
			         time series.
			      -) its name was changed from 'drawxaxis' to 'drawTimeAxis', in order to have a 
			         more intuitive name. The old 'drawxaxis' function is deprecated, but 
			         still be kept for back-compatibility reasons.			
	 		      -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 		         "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto".
	o 'hydroplot'       : -) it takes advantage of the new 'drawTimeAxis' function.
	  'sname2plot'      : -) now it is able to plot seasonal values (ptype="seasonal")
	                      -) it works with xts objects as well.
			      -) 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' now accept the values: "auto", "quarters", "weeks", "hours", 
	 		         "minutes", and "seconds", and its default value was changed to "auto". 
	 		      -) the name of 'x' is now used as default for the Y axis label.
	 		      -) an incorrect default title for the daily histogram was fixed.

	                      -) default value for the 'win.len2' argument was changed from 351*3 to 0, in order to avoid the 
	                         plotting of the 3-years moving average (by default)
	o 'hydroplot'       : -) new argument: 'date.fmt' for being used with the new arguments 'from' and 'to'
	o 'sfreq'           : -) it works now with xts objects
	o 'vector2zoo'      : -) added error checking for length of the numeric vector and the dates.
	o 'hydrokrige'      : -) updated documentation and new example of interpolation over a user-defined raster map.

Added functions:
*) 'zoo2RHtest': creation of the input file to the 'RHtest_dlyPrcp.r' script that test the homogeneity of climatological time series (http://ccma.seos.uvic.ca)

Modifications:
*) 'hydrokrige': -) The methodology for computing the block averages over the subcatchments was changed, from passing the subcatchments file to the 'autoKrige' or 'idw' function, to use the 'overaly' mehtod with 'fn=mean', because this is the only way to be sure that the 'cellsize'  given by the user is used in the sampling of the subcatchments (the 'sps.arg' argument couldn't be used in the 'idw' function )
                 -) Error checking added when all the measured values are equal, for avoiding the following error:
                     'chfactor.c", line 130: singular matrix in function LDLfactor()'                  
                 -) Added check: the shapefile with the subcatchments must be provided for block interpolations
                 -) Minor bugs corrected when plotting the results of a block interpolation carried out with idw.
*) 'sname2ts'  : -) the 'FUN' argument was removed as requirement when 'tstep.out' is 'daily'

                 -) The default value 'both' for the 'IDW.type' field was changed to 'cells', in case the user does not want the block values over subcatchments.
                 -) The name of the parameter 'var.type' was changed to 'ColorRamp', because it is more intuitive. Its default value was changed from'"Precipitation' to 'PCPAnomaly' because gives a better visual representation, The following possible sets of colours were added: c('PCPAnomaly', 'PCPAnomaly2', 'TEMPAnomaly', 'TEMPAnomaly2', 'TEMPAnomaly3')
                 -) Some bugfixes to the KED wrapper
############
# v 0.1.4: #
############

                 -) it is possible to include the 'idp' (inverse distance power) argument for inverse distance weighted interpolations.
                 -) a checking was added for avoiding that the shapefile with the subcatchments (given by 'subcatchments') and the geographical locations (given by 'x.gis') had different projections, wich prevent the interpolations with 'krige' function.
                 -) the argument 'output.fname' was changed to 'fname'
		 -) Some bugs in the wrapper to the 'autoKrige' function for block values over subcatchments were fixed.
                 -) When 'verbose=TRUE' and 'formula' is provided by the user, information related to the fitted variogram by the 'autoKrige' function is shown.

############
# v 0.1.3: #

                   A check was added, for detecting when a ts is too short for plotting annual values (length(x) <=366 when 'x' is daily), and the 'tick.tstep' and 'lab.tstep' are automatically changed to 'days' and 'months', respectively. The same checking procedure change 'pfreq' value to skip the annual plots.

*) 'mspplot'   : 3 new ColorRamps were added as possible alternatives for the 'ColorRamp' argument: 'PCPAnomaly2', 'TEMPAnomaly2' and 'TEMPAnomaly3'
*) 'tsgis2spt' : its name was changes to 'gists2spt (because it is closer to "spatio-temporal", according to me...)

############
# v 0.1.1: #
############
*) Release Date: 15-Sep-2009
*) 'daily2monthly.data.frame'. Previously, it gave the same result as 'daily2annual.data.frame'. This was corrected.
*) 'daily2monthly.data.frame'. The default argument for 'out.type' was set up to "db", because "data.frame" has no sense here
*) 'monthlytotals.data.frame'. Bug was corrected, because the monthly results were given by row instead of the corresponding column.
*) 'dwiplot'. Its name was changed to 'matrixplot' and a new parameter was added ('var.type') for indicating the color ramp that has to be used depending on the type of variable to be plotted (Days with information, precipitation, temperature)

*) 'hydroidw': The name of 'N.min', 'N.max' and 'Dist.Max' were changed to 'nmin', 'nmax', 'maxdist', in order to share terminology with the 'krige' function. of the 'gstat' package
               The default value of 'nmin' was cahnged from 1 to 0, for compatibility with the 'krige' function of the 'gstat' package.
               The following parameters were added:
              -)'predictors': OPTIONAL. SpatialGridDataFrame object, with prediction/simulation locations. Usually, a digital elevation model (DEM) read with the 'readGDAL' function of the 'rgdal' package. \cr
              -)'formula'   : Formula to be used in case of ordinary kriging or kriging with external drift. All the variables to be used within 'formula' has to be present both in 'x.gis' and 'predictors'. See the 'formula' argument in '?gstat::krige'. \cr
   

Changed names:

*) 'annualmeans'  : Its name was changed to 'annualfunction', because now it is possible to apply any R function to summarize the annual values
*) 'subset.zoo'   : Its name was changed to 'extractzoo', for avoiding conflicts with the default behaviour of the 'subset' function implemented int he zoo package
*) 'hydroidw'     : Its name was changed to 'hydrokrige' due to the addition of OK and KED interpolations through the 'autoKrige' function of the 'automap' package.

Added functions:
